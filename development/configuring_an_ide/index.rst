Configuring an IDE
==================

If you have not yet downloaded and compiled the Rebel Engine and Rebel Editor source code,
please read the :doc:`/development/compiling/index` section first.

Although you can modify the Rebel Engine and Rebel Editor source code using a text editor,
most people will want to use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
Which IDE to use will depend on your Operating System and personal preference.
Once you have installed your chosen IDE,
you will need to configure your IDE to build Rebel Engine and Rebel Editor using the desired options.
You will also need to configure your IDE to run and debug Rebel Editor or a Rebel game.

We have provided detailed instructions for setting up some of the most popular IDEs:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   android_studio
   clion
   code_blocks
   kdevelop
   qt_creator
   visual_studio
   visual_studio_code
   xcode

It is possible to use other IDEs, but their setup is not documented yet.
